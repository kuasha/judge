Calculate the sum of all numbers and show output
Calculate sum of all numbers at the odd position and sum at the even positions and print the difference between those
Add 3 to all the numbers and then print the new numbers
Add 5 to all even numbers and print the entire array
Go through the entire array and find the smallest and biggest number in it and print the difference
Reverse the array inplace (without creating a new one)
Find the minimum item in the array and swap it with the value at index zero, then start from index one and find the minimum number from the rest and swap with item at index one.
Extend the program in question 19 to do it for all 15 positions (you need a for loop in another for loop
Leave the number at zero index but for other numbers arrange the numbers in such a order that number at index 1 is smaller than numbers at index 2 and 3. Number at index 2 is smaller than numbers at index 4 and 5. So for each index X the number at X is smaller than number at X*2 and X*2+1.
